🐍 Snake Game on LED Matrix with Arduino

This project implements the classic Snake Game using an Arduino, an LED matrix, and a joystick module for control. The player moves the snake across the matrix to collect food and grow while avoiding collisions.

🎮 Features

✅ Control the snake using an analog joystick module.
✅ Display the game on an 8x8 LED matrix.
✅ Grow the snake as it eats food.
✅ Collision detection with walls and itself.
✅ Game restarts when the snake crashes.

🔧 Components Used

Arduino (Uno, Mega, or any compatible board)
8x8 LED Matrix with MAX7219 driver
Analog Joystick Module
Jumper wires for connections
📌 How It Works
The game is displayed on the LED matrix, where the snake moves and grows as it collects food. The player controls the snake's direction using an analog joystick module, which sends signals to the Arduino to update the snake's position in real-time.

🚀 How to Play

Upload the code to your Arduino.
Connect the LED matrix and joystick module properly.
Start the game and move the snake using the joystick.
Have fun and try to beat your own high score!
